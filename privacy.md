# Privacy

## What We Collect

We prefer to keep zero information about customers, about you. If an application's functionality depends on stored information, we will retain only the bare minimum, encrypt it with industry best practices, and allow you to see at any time exactly what we're storing.

## Analytics and Trackers

We believe "big data" marketing is an impulse and force contrary to basic humanitarian principles.

We may note completely _anonymous_, _moment-in-time_ information that is an automatic part of a web page view, like time of day and the language your browser is configured to use.

That can help us know where to focus translation efforts or improve our support schedule &mdash; things to really help *you*.

But we will not include any third-party analytics or trackers within our sites or applications. We don't need to know that you're 34-years-old and just bought your first toaster yesterday. We won't benefit from or contribute to a practice we consider invasive, creepy and, frankly, dehumanizing.
